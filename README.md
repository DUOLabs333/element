Element.py: A python script for information about the periodic table in the terminal.

How to use: Running `./element` will give you a REPL where you can put in the name of an element or its symbol (in any case), and it will give you information about it. Passing the name as an argument will just give you the information without the REPL. Running `./element table` will give you console ouput of the periodic table.
